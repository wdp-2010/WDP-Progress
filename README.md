## 🎮 Progress Scale Explained

The progress score (1-100) represents a player's overall advancement through the game:

### Progress Tiers

| Score | Tier | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1-20 | **Beginner** | Just started, basic tools and resources |
| 21-40 | **Novice** | Iron age, initial exploration, early advancements |
| 41-60 | **Intermediate** | Diamond tools, nether access, established base |
| 61-80 | **Advanced** | End dimension, elytra, advanced enchantments |
| 81-99 | **Expert** | Netherite gear, wither defeated, extensive achievements |
| 100 | **Master** | Complete mastery of all game aspects |

### What Affects Your Score?

#### 1. **Advancements (25%)** - Story Progression
- Completing Minecraft advancements across all categories
- Key milestones: Enter Nether (+10), Kill Dragon (+20), Get Elytra (+15)
- Weighted by importance: Story (35%), End (25%), Nether (20%)

#### 2. **Experience (15%)** - Player Levels
- Based on XP levels with diminishing returns
- Level 10 = Early game, Level 30 = Mid game, Level 100 = Master
- Uses logarithmic scaling to prevent grinding abuse

#### 3. **Equipment (20%)** - Gear Quality
- Evaluates armor, tools, weapons, and special items
- Material tier: Netherite (10 pts) > Diamond (8) > Iron (3) > Stone (1)
- Enchantments boost value significantly (Mending +150%, Fortune +140%)
- Damaged items worth less, full armor sets get 15% bonus
- Checks inventory + ender chest for best items

#### 4. **Economy (15%)** - Wealth
- Money/balance with logarithmic scaling
- $100 = ~20% progress, $10,000 = ~40%, $1,000,000 = 100%
- Milestone bonuses at key thresholds
- Requires Vault + economy plugin

#### 5. **Statistics (15%)** - Gameplay Metrics
- Mob kills (boss kills worth more: Dragon +50, Wither +40, Warden +30)
- Blocks mined (valuable ores worth more: Ancient Debris +10, Diamond +5)
- Distance traveled (exploration encourages progress)
- Playtime (with diminishing returns)
- Death penalty: -0.5 points per death

#### 6. **Achievements (10%)** - Custom Milestones
- Server-specific achievements defined in config
- Can be granted by other plugins via API
- Examples: first_join, master_builder, legendary_fighter

## 🔌 API Usage

WDP Progress provides a comprehensive API for other plugins.

### Basic Usage

```java
// Get the API instance
WDPProgressPlugin progressPlugin = (WDPProgressPlugin) Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("WDPProgress");
ProgressAPI api = progressPlugin.getProgressAPI();

// Get player progress (1-100)
double progress = api.getPlayerProgress(player);

// Check if player has reached a threshold
if (api.hasProgress(player, 50.0)) {
    // Player is at least level 50 progress
    player.sendMessage("You've reached intermediate level!");
}

// Grant custom achievement
api.grantAchievement(player, "master_builder");

// Force recalculation
double newProgress = api.recalculateProgress(player);
```

### Listen to Progress Changes

```java
@EventHandler
public void onProgressChange(ProgressChangeEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    double oldProgress = event.getOldProgress();
    double newProgress = event.getNewProgress();
    
    if (event.isIncrease()) {
        player.sendMessage("Progress increased by " + event.getProgressDelta());
    }
    
    // Check if player reached a milestone
    if (oldProgress < 50 && newProgress >= 50) {
        // Player just reached intermediate level
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage(player.getName() + " reached Intermediate level!");
    }
}
```

See [API.md](docs/API.md) for complete API documentation.

## 🏗️ Building
